Hints for challenge Small blocks
================================

The block length of our cipher is just 1 byte and we use it in CBC mode. We know that short blocks are not desirable in this case, because we can observe indentical blocks in a ciphertext of reasonable length with high probability. When identical blocks are found in the ciphertext, information about the corresponding plaintext blocks is leaked. 

More specifically, letâ€™s assume that we have two encrypted blocks:
	Y_i = E_K(X_i + Y_(i-1))
	Y_j = E_K(X_j + Y_(j-1))
that happen to be equal:
	Y_i = Y_j

This means that 
	D_K(Y_i) = D_K(Y_j) 
which means that
	X_i + Y_(i-1) = X_j + Y_(j-1)
or equivalently
	X_i + X_j = Y_(i-1) + Y_(j-1) 

Now, if X_i is known to the attacker (by whatever means, e.g., it's public data), then X_j is also disclosed:
	X_j = Y_(i-1) + Y_(j-1) + X_i 
	
That's what you can use to solve this challenge...

First, align the plaintext and the ciphertext to see which blocks belong to each other:

   ...


You will observe that there are identical blocks in the ciphertext, and in particular some of the ciphertext blocks that correspond to the missing part of the plaintext appear elsewhere in the ciphertext. You can compute the corresponding missing plaintext blocks!

Please note that there may be characters in the missing part of the plaintext that you cannot recover. So some guess work will be needed at the very end.
