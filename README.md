# Applying Cryptography

### Task One: Skytale and Four Square.
Brute-forcing the period length decrypt a scytale message. 
And decrypting a second message encrypted with four square matrices.

### Task Two: Stream Ciphers.
Finding the key to decrypt an English text encrypted with the simple XOR cipher.
Given three valid transaction records decrypted with an XOR cipher and the same,
we forge a new valid transaction record to transfer a large sum is transferred to our account.

### Task Three: Block Ciphers.
Given some plain text and its corresponding cipher text encrypted with an MD5 
three-round Feistel block cipher, figure out the key.
